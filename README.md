# fan_crik
fan_crik is a python gui project. I used PyQT5 for this project. PyQt5 is a module that can be used to create graphical user interfaces (GUI). And SQLite for storing records. SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine. This project is a small cricket game.
